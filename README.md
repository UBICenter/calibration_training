# UBI Center Calibration Training

Calibration training for drilling findings from UBI and related studies.

Inspired by Danny Hernandez's calibration trainings at
[Twitch](https://hbr.org/2017/05/how-our-company-learned-to-make-better-predictions-about-everything),
[Open Philanthropy Project](https://openphilanthropy.org/calibration),
and [Evident Method](http://evidentmethod.com/training).

Danny also shared code which this will be based on, using the
[Guided Track](http://guidedtrack.com) platform.
